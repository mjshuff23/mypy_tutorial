from typing import Union, Iterable, Dict, Callable, Iterator

def greet_all(names: Iterable[str]) -> None:
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello {name}")

friends1 = ['Michael', 'Bob', 'Alice']
friends2 = ('Michael', 'Bob', 'Alice')

greet_all(friends1)
greet_all(friends2)

# As another example, suppose you want to write a function that can accept either ints or strings, but no other types. You can express this using the Union type:

def normalize_id(user_id: Union[int, str]) -> str:
    if isinstance(user_id, int):
        return 'user-{}'.format(100000 + user_id)
    else:
        return user_id

print(normalize_id(12451251))
print(normalize_id('12451251'))

# Similarly, suppose that you want the function to accept only strings or None. You can again use Union and use Union[str, None] â€“ or alternatively, use the type Optional[str]. These two types are identical and interchangeable: Optional[str] is just a shorthand or alias for Union[str, None]. It exists mostly as a convenience to help function signatures look a little cleaner:

from typing import Optional

def greeting(name: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    # Optional[str] is shorthand for Union[str, None]
    if name is None:
        name = 'stranger'
    return f"Hello, {name}"

print(greeting())
print(greeting('Michael'))

# Type inference - By default, mypy infers types for you. You can instruct mypy to infer types for you by adding type annotations. For example, you can tell mypy that a function returns a string like so:
def nums_below(numbers: Iterable[float], limit: float) -> list[float]:
    output = []
    for number in numbers:
        if number < limit:
            output.append(number)
    return output

print(nums_below((1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0), 3.0))

# Mypy will warn you if it is unable to determine the type of some variable â€“ for example, when assigning an empty dictionary to some global value:
# my_global_dict = {} # Error: Need type annotation for 'my_global_dict'
my_global_dict: dict[int, float] = {}

# You can teach mypy what type my_global_dict is meant to have by giving it a type hint. For example, if you knew this variable is supposed to be a dict of ints to floats, you could annotate it using either variable annotations (introduced in Python 3.6 by PEP 526) or using a comment-based syntax like so:

#  Python 3.9+
my_global_dict_2: dict[int, float] = {}

# Python 3.6+
my_global_dict_3: Dict[int, float] = {}

# If you want compatibility with even older versions of Python
my_global_dict_4 = {} # type: Dict[int, float]

########################## Library stubs and typeshed ##########################
# Mypy uses library stubs to type check code interacting with library modules, including the Python standard library. A library stub defines a skeleton of the public interface of the library, including classes, variables and functions, and their types. Mypy ships with stubs for the standard library from the typeshed project, which contains library stubs for the Python builtins, the standard library, and selected third-party packages.
# For example, consider this code:
x = chr(4)
print(x)

# For tuples of fixed size, we specify the types of all the elements
y: tuple[int, str, float] = (3, "yes", 7.5)  # Python 3.9+

# Annotating a callable function value
# z: Callable[[int, float], float] = f
